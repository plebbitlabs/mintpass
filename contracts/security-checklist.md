yarn solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
```

## ‚úÖ Manual Security Review

### Access Control ‚úÖ
- [x] Only MINTER_ROLE can mint tokens
- [x] Only ADMIN_ROLE can change baseURI  
- [x] Admin cannot steal/revoke NFTs
- [x] No backdoors in contract

### Economic Security ‚úÖ
- [x] No reentrancy risks (no external calls)
- [x] No overflow issues (Solidity 0.8.24)
- [x] No gas griefing vectors
- [x] Token IDs increment predictably

### Logic Security ‚úÖ
- [x] All functions have proper access control
- [x] Array bounds checked in batch operations
- [x] Token existence validated before operations
- [x] Event emission for important state changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Risks

### Low Risk
1. **Gas Optimization**: Some utility functions could be more gas efficient
2. **Token Type Validation**: No validation that tokenType values are meaningful

### Medium Risk  
1. **External Integration**: Challenge system depends on external verification
2. **Key Management**: Private keys for ADMIN/MINTER roles need secure storage

## üîß Security Recommendations

### Before Mainnet:
1. **Run automated tools** (Slither, Mythril)
2. **Code review** by experienced Solidity developer
3. **Testnet deployment** with real usage testing
4. **Bug bounty** on testnet (even small rewards help)

### Production Security:
1. **Hardware wallet** for admin role
2. **Multisig** for critical operations  
3. **Monitoring** for unusual minting patterns
4. **Emergency pause** mechanism (future version)

## üìä Risk Assessment

**Overall Security Level: MEDIUM-HIGH** 

‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Built on audited OpenZeppelin contracts
- Simple, clear logic
- No complex DeFi interactions
- Good access control patterns

‚ö†Ô∏è **Areas for Improvement:**
- Need external security review
- Test on mainnet with small amounts first
- Monitor for unexpected usage patterns
