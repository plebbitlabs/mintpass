# MintPass - NFT Authentication Middleware for Plebbit

<img src="public/mintpass.png" alt="MintPass Logo" width="90" align="left" />

MintPass is an NFT-based authentication system that provides verified identity proofs for Plebbit communities (subplebbits). Users can mint verification NFTs (like SMS verification) that serve as anti-spam and identity verification mechanisms in decentralized communities. MintPass enables subplebbit owners to tell their users apart, counting them, banning them and thus preventing sybil attacks such as fake upvotes/downvotes, fake conversations, etc.

## Getting Started

### Smart Contract Testing
```bash
cd contracts
yarn install
yarn deploy-and-test  # Deploy and test on local Hardhat network
```

### Deployment Scripts
```bash
# Deploy to testnet with deterministic addresses
yarn deploy:deterministic:testnet

# Deploy and test locally
yarn deploy-and-test
```

This repository is actively in development. Follow the milestones above to track progress.
